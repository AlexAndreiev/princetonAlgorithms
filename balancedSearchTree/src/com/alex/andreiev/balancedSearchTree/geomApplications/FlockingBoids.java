/* Flocking boids (Craig Reynolds, 1986)
* Boids. Three simple rules lead to complex emergent flocking behavior:
*   - collision avoidance: point away from k nearest boids
*   - flock centering: point towards the center of mass of k nearest boids
*   - velocity matching: update velocity to the average of k nearest boids
* */
